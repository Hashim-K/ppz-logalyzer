## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- **Rust Backend**: Follow Rust 2021 edition standards, use Clippy for linting
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Strict TypeScript config, ESLint + Prettier for formatting
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage, unit and integration tests required
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must be documented

### Git Workflow

1. Create feature branches from `main`: `feature/issue-{number}-short-description`
2. Regular commits with conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
3. Pull request required for all changes to `main`
4. CI/CD pipeline must pass before merge

### Performance Targets

- **Backend Response Time**: < 100ms for cached requests
- **File Processing**: Sub-second parsing for files up to 100MB
- **Frontend Load Time**: < 3s initial page load
- **Memory Usage**: Max 2GB RAM for typical workloads

## Next Actions for Agent

### Immediate Priority (Start Here)

1. **Begin with Issue #1**: Set up Docker containers and development environment
2. **Then Issue #3**: Design and implement database schema
3. **Then Issue #9**: Set up Next.js frontend framework

### Development Strategy

- Focus on one issue at a time to avoid context switching
- Complete all tasks within an issue before moving to the next
- Update task status in this file as work progresses
- Create sub-issues in GitHub for complex tasks that need breakdown

### Progress Tracking

- Update GitHub issue comments with progress updates
- Mark tasks as complete in both GitHub issues and this task list
- Move to next phase only when all P0 tasks are complete
- Regular standup updates on blockers and dependencies
